# minecraft-warden-drop-fix
Datapack for Minecraft 1.19 fixing Warden drops.

## Overview

I think everybody was a bit disappointed to learn, that epic boss such as Warden doesn't drop anything special...
So I made this datapack to fix it!

Warden still drops Sculk Catalyst, but if you kill it with anything enchanted with Silk Touch, it will drop Primed Sculk Shrieker instead.

## Primed Sculk Shrieker

Primed Sculk Shrieker is, as the name suggests, primed Sculk Shrieker. It CAN summon Wardens after it's placed down;
However, once you place Primed Sculk Shrieker down it behaves like normal Sculk Shrieker, so if mined and re-placed it cannot summon Warden anymore - so be cautious to place it exactly where you want it!

I believe having option to place working Sculk Shrieker anywhere will allow creation of much better and more amazing minigames, challenge rooms etc. in survival minecraft (and surely I will use it on my server!); And surely it's better reward for such achievement than mere single Sculk Catalyst!

On the other side, it's hard enough to kill Warden with Silk Touch (so probably axe), that it will be very tough to cause any serious grief using Primed Sculk Shrieker.

## Lore

As Warden is summoned by scream of souls trapped in Sculk Shrieker, and it itself has souls trapped inside of it's chest, it makes sense to me to be able to "extract" those souls by killing Warden with Silk Touch.
